# Assets-front-end
exercise front-end of assets


- Part of the back-end assets exercise involves creating a login that makes a request to the backend to obtain an authentication token, enabling access to other components.

There is a component called ASSET, which, in turn, can initiate a dialog with two other components, namely ASSET-COMPUTER and ASSET-TELEFONO. These components allow you to add a computer and a phone to the back-end, respectively.

There are also TABLE-ASSET and INFO-ASSET components that allow access to information related to the existing assets.

(Note that this exercise is not complete and requires further modifications; it was carried out solely for the purpose of understanding how to connect the back-end to the front-end and obtain a user interface.)
